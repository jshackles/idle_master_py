In the spirit of open source and free software there are no Linux binaries provided. Instead run the Python script directly using the command "python2 start.py".

The script needs these Python 2 packages to run:
requests
beautifulsoup4
pillow (with jpeg and tk support)
colorama

Examples for packages that meet the dependencies:
Ubuntu: python-bs4 python-requests python-pil.imagetk python-colorama
Arch Linux: python2-beautifulsoup4 python2-requests python2-pillow tk python2-colorama
